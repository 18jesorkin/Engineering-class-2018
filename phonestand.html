  Phone stand

All I basically did was <strong> extrude </strong> a circle and then extruded 2 rectangles <br>
(one in front and the other behind the thinly extruded circle) to act as "planks", one to support the circular base at an <br>
angle to the ground, the other to support the phone against the circular base. It's a vey lazy design but due to time constraints <br>
and my lack of knowledge on the software, it's the best I could come up with. <br>

 <strong> Extrude:</strong> Adding depth to a shape to create a basic object with a constant cross sectional area.
 <em> Ex: </em> circle -> extrudes to -> cylinder
