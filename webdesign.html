<h1> Web Design </h1>
<br>
  <h2> Basic Ideas </h2>
  <br>
<p> The whole idea behind code is you have these things called "tags" that specify what things are <br>
or how they function. For example, the "<p>" tag identifies written bodies as paragraphs, the "<h1>" tag identifies  a <br>
written body as a heading, the "<a>" tag identifies a written body as a hyperlink. How  mosttags identify what they're <br>
being applied to is by what enclosed by the opening and closing tags. The closing tag is just the opening tag but with <br>
a slash put next to the letter inside the tag. For example, the closing tage for "<h1>" would be "</h1>", the closing tag <br>
for "<p>" would be "</p>", etc. If I would want to identify "The cat eats bacon" as a heading, I would put <br>
"<h1> The cat eats bacon </h1>". <br>
