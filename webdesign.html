<h1> Web Design </h1>
<br>
  <h2> Basic Ideas </h2>
  <br>
<p> 
The whole idea behind code is you have these things called "tags" that specify what things are <br>
or how they function. For example, the "p" * tag identifies written bodies as paragraphs, the "h1" tag identifies  a <br>
written body as a heading, the "a" tag identifies a written body as a hyperlink. How  mosttags identify what they're <br>
being applied to is by what enclosed by the opening and closing tags. The closing tag is just the opening tag but with <br>
a slash put next to the letter inside the tag. For example, the closing tage for "h1" would be "/h1", the closing tag <br>
for "p" would be "/p", etc. If I would want to identify "The cat eats bacon" as a heading, I would put <br>
"h1 The cat eats bacon /h1". <br>
  <br>
  <strong>*Please note* </strong>- An actual tag would be surrounded by "< >", so it would really be "<letters>". <br>
  However I can't put the following tags in "< >" because the computer would read the tags and they wouldn't register. <br>
  Just know that every tag will always be surrounded by "< >". If you're confused, just look at the source code by pressing <br>
  "ctrl+u" and observe all the tags, you'll see what I'm talking about. <br>
  <br>
  <h2> Overall thoughts </h2> <br> 
  <br>
  Web designing for me is just ok. I mean yeah sure it is a cool concept to create this thing that millions of people around <br>
  the world can look at, and there's definitely a career in it if your really good. But I don't really have anything I'd like to <br>
  create a website for and it can be a very tedious job. At least the skills are there if I ever wanna use them but
