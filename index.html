    <h1> Explo in engineering</h1>
    <p>
      I am currently a student enrolled in the exploration in engineering class <br> 
      under instructor Mr. Corey Rice. The purpose of this class is to explore <br> 
      the basics of technical engineering amoung other things (such as coding).

  <h1> Brief about me </h1>
  
  <p> I am an 18 year old at Mayfield Highschool who enjoys music, drawing, origami, and  math.<br>
    For music, I'd say I lean more so to 60's, 70's, and 80's rock (Journey, some Deep Purple, ELP,bit of Beatles, <br>
  etc.) though I do listen to almost all genres. I don't know, anyhting I'm "in the mood for". I'm currently taking <br>
 Advanced Art 1 and have enjoyed drawing a variety of subjects from hands, feet, construction vehicles, etc. I do like origami <br>
  but I do at times hate it, it's disappointing to have a 1-2 hour project just rip in your hands or fail to turn out as you <br>
 expected, so I've been taking a bit of a 3-4 month break from it. For math I'm studying Calculus BC and am currently on <br> 
the Definite Integral and its properties.
