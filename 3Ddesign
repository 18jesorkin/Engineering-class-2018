<h1> Thoughts on 3D Design </h1>
<br>
<p> The basicist basic most oversimplified idea behind 3D design is to draw a flat shape and extrude it <br>
(pull it out to a certain width). Let me just say that I'm personally not a fan of 3D design in general for two reasons: <br>
<br>
1) I just don't know how to properly use any of the software <br>
<br>
2) It's just not worth the effort. <br>
<br>
You see, we were supposed to learn the software on our own via online tutorials or just experimenting with it <br>
and while that's all good and dandy, unfortunatly I had other priorities and was thus unable to properly learn the software.<br>
This problem came to a head when I was working on the major assigment for the unit "Design omething that can only be 3D printed". <br>
I decided to create a scaled down, simplified version of an f-15 jet and decided to do it by finding a dimensioned drawing <br>
of said jet and braking down it's major pieces, simplifying all the curves to edges and tweaking shapes to make them easier <br>
to draw in the software. It took hours of physical measuring, converting "measured inches" off the physical drawing to <br>
"desired inches" of the real life model, drawing and extruding in Inventor (the software I picked to use), and etc. <br>
Finally when I got all the seperate pieces made, I decided to try putting them together in Inventor's aptly named <br>
"Assembly" mode. Turns out, I either can't use "Assembly" for this purposeor don't know enough about the assembly mode to <br>
use it properly. Well that's just great. So I asked around for thelp and the best reply I got was, "Make the jet in one part file." <br>
Well, I don't know how to navigate and assemble 3D parts in a "part" file so that's out, meaning my only option left was to <br>
print out every single piece and manually glue them together like some sort of kit. <br>
<br>
  As I was about to do this I started thinking,"Wait, why would in the world would I do that? I could've just ordered an f-15 <br>
kit online and saved myself hours of confusion. This is absolutely pointless. And I'm spending all this time for a stupid little <br>
airplane? What a joke." The effort and time put in just wasn't worth the final product, it was just such a ntime consuming bore <br>
to make every little itty bitty part only to fail at the very last step because you can't put the bloody thing together.<br>
  <br>
  So yeah, I hope I never have to touch Inventor again, there is nothing more frustrating than messing with a software <br>
you don't understand, wasting countless hours for nothing. Maybe I'll give 3D design a second chance if I can find a class that <br>
teaches all the specifics on the software, but for now I'm completely done with 3D printing. Or maybe I'm just lazy, could be that too.
