<h1> Arduino Â  </h1>
<br>
<h2> Basics </h2> <br>
<br>
<p> The simple idea behind Arduimo programing is to create a closed electrial circuit with your positive and ground <br>
 both on the Arduino. You then input ode through the Arduino program on your computer to control the different things <br>
on your circuit. Simply put, it's just computer coding and electrical circuits. So far all we've really overed are LED <br>
features such as blink and fade.<br>
  <br>
Generally when making circuits, you use a small box called a "Bread-board", whih is just a small white box <br>
with metal wires running thoughout. <br>
  <br>
  <h2> Overall thoughts </h2> <br>
  <br>
It's ok, I'm not much of  tehy guy so it really doesn't peak my interest much. (Shrug). I guess it'll get a little cooler <br>
when we use Arduino for other things, but for now it's kinda mech. Maybe I'll be more enthusiasti about it after a nice Winter Break.
