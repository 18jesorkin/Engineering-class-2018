<h1> Football data-science </h1>
<p>The way the football dat-science "program" works is we are given scrimmage <br>
and practice data, in the form of a microsoft excell spreadsheet, of the team our school will be playing next Friday. We are then left to <br> 
analyze it as we see fit, looking for some sort of pattern that could give our side some sort of edge. While it is an interesting <br>
experiment in analytics and organizing info, I usually wind up doing the same 10minute procedure every Friday because I don't know excell<br>
 that well and I also have othher stuff to work on. <br>
 <br> 
What I usually do is I use a pivot table to compare the team's off. form with it's off. play and figure out what's the % liklihood <br>
that they would run this play in this formation.
