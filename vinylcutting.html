<h1> Vinyl cutting </h1>
<p> The next project after football-datascience was learning the basics for the vinyl/laesr cutter <br> 
and Corell draw (the program we use to create cutting templates for the machine). The first thing we had to do was <br>
 find a raster image off the internet that we would like to cut out as a sticker (a raster image is an image entirely made out o pixels). <br>   
 For my raster image, I just chose a generation 1 Decepticon logo cause I'm a Transformers nerd. <br>
<img src="http://img00.deviantart.net/db88/i/2014/338/4/a/g1_decepticon_by_jmk_prime-d88mq8o.png" height="190"> </img> <br>
 Next I copy and pasted the image into Corell <strong> vectorized </strong> the image.I then removed the image's removed the color
 and outlined it in black.

I then took the new <strong> vector image </strong> and put it on a flash drive before taking it down to the laser/ vinyl cutter. <br>
Next I plugged the flash drive and chose a color for the vinyl sticker while Mr. Rice set up the cutting blade on the vinyl cutter <br>
and got the cutting template ready to go.
