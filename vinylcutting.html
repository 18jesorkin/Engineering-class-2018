<h1> Vinyl cutting </h1>
<p> The next project after football-datascience was learning the basics for the vinyl/laesr cutter <br> 
and Corell draw (the program we use to create cutting templates for the machine). The first thing we had to do was <br>
 find a <strong> raster image </strong> off the internet that we would like to cut out as a sticker.<br>   
 For my raster image, I just chose a generation 1 Decepticon logo cause I'm a Transformers nerd. <br>

 Next I copy and pasted the image into Corell and <strong> vectorized</strong> it before removing its color <br> 
 and outlining it in black. <br>
 <br>
I then took the new <strong> vector image </strong> and put it on a flash drive before taking it down to the laser/ vinyl cutter. <br>
Next I plugged the flash drive and chose a color for the vinyl sticker while Mr. Rice set up the cutting blade on the vinyl cutter <br>
and got the cutting template ready to go. He then ran the cutter and 5 minutes later I got my Decepticon sticker <br>
which I put on the back of my Chromebook. <br>

<strong> Raster image: </strong> An image that is entirely made out of pixels. <br>
<strong> Vector image: </strong> An image that is entirely made out of vectors (straight lines) <br>
of various sizes and lengths. <br>
<strong> Vectorization: </strong> Changing an image from a raster image to a vector image.
