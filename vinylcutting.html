<h1> Vinyl cutting </h1>
<p> The next project after football-datascience was learning the basics for the vinyl/laesr cutter <br> 
and Corell draw (the program we use to create cutting templates for the machine). The first thing we had to do was <br>
 find a raster image off the internet that we would like to cut out as a sticker (a raster image is an image entirely made out o pixels). <br>
  For my raster image, I just chose a generation 1 Decepticon logo cause I'm a Transformers nerd.
